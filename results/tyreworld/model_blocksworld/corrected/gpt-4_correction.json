                "content": "You are defining the preconditions and effects (represented in PDDL format) of an AI agent's actions. Information about the AI agent will be provided in the domain description. Note that individual conditions in preconditions and effects should be listed separately. For example, \"object_1 is washed and heated\" should be considered as two separate conditions \"object_1 is washed\" and \"object_1 is heated\". Also, in PDDL, two predicates cannot have the same name even if they have different parameters. Each predicate in PDDL must have a unique name, and its parameters must be explicitly defined in the predicate definition. It is recommended to define predicate names in an intuitive and readable way.\n\nHere are two examples from the classical BlocksWorld domain for demonstrating the output format.\n\nDomain information: BlocksWorld is a planning domain in artificial intelligence. The AI agent here is a mechanical robot arm that can pick and place the blocks. Only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved. There is only one type of object in this domain, and that is the block.\n\nExample 1\nAction: This action enables the robot to put a block onto the table. For example, the robot puts block_1 onto the table.\n\nYou can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:\nNo predicate has been defined yet\n\nParameters:\n1. ?x - block: the block to put down\n\nPreconditions:\n```\n(and\n    (robot-holding ?x)\n)\n```\n\nEffects:\n```\n(and\n    (not (robot-holding ?x))\n    (block-clear ?x)\n    (robot-hand-empty)\n    (block-on-table ?x)\n)\n```\n\nNew Predicates:\n1. (robot-holding ?x - block): true if the robot arm is holding the block ?x\n2. (block-clear ?x - block): true if the block ?x is not under any another block\n3. (robot-hand-empty): true if the robot arm is not holding any block\n4. (block-on-table ?x - block): true if the block ?x is placed on the table\n\n\nExample 2\nAction: This action enables the robot to pick up a block on the table.\n\nYou can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:\n1. (robot-holding ?x - block): true if the robot arm is holding the block ?x\n2. (block-clear ?x - block): true if the block ?x is not under any another block\n3. (robot-hand-empty): true if the robot arm is not holding any block\n4.

This involves fetching the tools (wrench, jack, pump) from the boot, undoing the nuts on the flat tyre, jacking up the (appropriate) hub(s), removing the tyre, doing up the spare one, etc. There are three major object types: `small_object`, `container` and `hub`. The object type `small_object` covers tools, wheels and nuts. The `small_object` object type has three subtypes: `tool`, `wheel` and `nut`. The subtype `tool` covers tools like wrenches, jacks, pumps etc. The subtype `wheel` covers various wheels. The subtype `nut` covers various nuts. The object type `container` covers storage spaces like the boot in a car. The object type `hub` covers the hubs in the wheels of the car. Note that there is no restriction on how many objects the AI agent (i.e., the robot) can carry. Also note that each hub has only one nut.\n\nAction: This action enables the robot to tighten a nut in a hub. For example, the robot can tighten nut_1 in hub_1. To safely perform this action, the hub needs to be on the ground (i.e., not jacked-up).\n\nYou can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:\n1. (container-closed ?c - container): true if the container ?c is closed\n2. (container-open ?c - container): true if the container ?c is open\n3. (object-in-container ?x - small_object ?c - container): true if the object ?x is inside the container ?c\n4. (robot-holding ?x - small_object): true if the robot is holding the object ?x\n5. (nut-on-hub ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is on the hub ?h\n6. (hub-on-ground ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is on the ground (not jacked-up)\n7. (nut-tight ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is tight on the hub ?h\n8. (nut-loose ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is loose on the hub ?h\n9.

(hub-unfastened ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is unfastened\n13. (wheel-on-hub ?w - wheel ?h - hub): true if the wheel ?w is on the hub ?h\n14. (is-pump ?p - tool): true if the tool ?p is a pump\n15. (is-wheel ?w - wheel): true if the object ?w is a wheel\n16. (wheel-intact ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w is intact\n17. (wheel-deflated ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w is deflated\n18.
