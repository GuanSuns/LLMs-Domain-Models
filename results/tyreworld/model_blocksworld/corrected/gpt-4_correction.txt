Action: Tighten a nut in a hub
####################
--------------------
user:
You are defining the preconditions and effects (represented in PDDL format) of an AI agent's actions. Information about the AI agent will be provided in the domain description. Note that individual conditions in preconditions and effects should be listed separately. For example, "object_1 is washed and heated" should be considered as two separate conditions "object_1 is washed" and "object_1 is heated". Also, in PDDL, two predicates cannot have the same name even if they have different parameters. Each predicate in PDDL must have a unique name, and its parameters must be explicitly defined in the predicate definition. It is recommended to define predicate names in an intuitive and readable way.

Here are two examples from the classical BlocksWorld domain for demonstrating the output format.

Domain information: BlocksWorld is a planning domain in artificial intelligence. The AI agent here is a mechanical robot arm that can pick and place the blocks. Only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved. There is only one type of object in this domain, and that is the block.

Example 1
Action: This action enables the robot to put a block onto the table. For example, the robot puts block_1 onto the table.

You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
No predicate has been defined yet

Parameters:
1. ?x - block: the block to put down

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (robot-holding ?x)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (robot-holding ?x))
    (block-clear ?x)
    (robot-hand-empty)
    (block-on-table ?x)
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (robot-holding ?x - block): true if the robot arm is holding the block ?x
2. (block-clear ?x - block): true if the block ?x is not under any another block
3. (robot-hand-empty): true if the robot arm is not holding any block
4. (block-on-table ?x - block): true if the block ?x is placed on the table


Example 2
Action: This action enables the robot to pick up a block on the table.

You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
1. (robot-holding ?x - block): true if the robot arm is holding the block ?x
2. (block-clear ?x - block): true if the block ?x is not under any another block
3. (robot-hand-empty): true if the robot arm is not holding any block
4. (block-on-table ?x - block): true if the block ?x is placed on the table

Parameters:
1. ?x - block: the block to pick up

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (block-clear ?x)
    (block-on-table ?x)
    (robot-hand-empty)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (block-on-table ?x))
    (not (block-clear ?x))
    (not (robot-hand-empty))
    (robot-holding ?x)
)

Here is the task.

Domain information: The AI agent here is a robot that has to replace a flat tyre with a spare one. This involves fetching the tools (wrench, jack, pump) from the boot, undoing the nuts on the flat tyre, jacking up the (appropriate) hub(s), removing the tyre, doing up the spare one, etc. There are three major object types: `small_object`, `container` and `hub`. The object type `small_object` covers tools, wheels and nuts. The `small_object` object type has three subtypes: `tool`, `wheel` and `nut`. The subtype `tool` covers tools like wrenches, jacks, pumps etc. The subtype `wheel` covers various wheels. The subtype `nut` covers various nuts. The object type `container` covers storage spaces like the boot in a car. The object type `hub` covers the hubs in the wheels of the car. Note that there is no restriction on how many objects the AI agent (i.e., the robot) can carry. Also note that each hub has only one nut.

Action: This action enables the robot to tighten a nut in a hub. For example, the robot can tighten nut_1 in hub_1. To safely perform this action, the hub needs to be on the ground (i.e., not jacked-up).

You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
1. (container-closed ?c - container): true if the container ?c is closed
2. (container-open ?c - container): true if the container ?c is open
3. (object-in-container ?x - small_object ?c - container): true if the object ?x is inside the container ?c
4. (robot-holding ?x - small_object): true if the robot is holding the object ?x
5. (nut-on-hub ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is on the hub ?h
6. (hub-on-ground ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is on the ground (not jacked-up)
7. (nut-tight ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is tight on the hub ?h
8. (nut-loose ?n - nut ?h - hub): true if the nut ?n is loose on the hub ?h
9. (is-wrench ?w - tool): true if the tool ?w is a wrench
10. (is-jack ?j - tool): true if the tool ?j is a jack
11. (hub-jacked-up ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is jacked up (not on the ground)
12. (hub-unfastened ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is unfastened
13. (wheel-on-hub ?w - wheel ?h - hub): true if the wheel ?w is on the hub ?h
14. (is-pump ?p - tool): true if the tool ?p is a pump
15. (is-wheel ?w - wheel): true if the object ?w is a wheel
16. (wheel-intact ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w is intact
17. (wheel-deflated ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w is deflated
18. (wheel-inflated ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w is inflated

Parameters:
--------------------
--------------------
assistant:
1. ?n - nut: the nut to be tightened
2. ?h - hub: the hub where the nut is to be tightened
3. ?w - tool: the wrench to be used for tightening the nut

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (nut-loose ?n ?h)
    (hub-on-ground ?h)
    (robot-holding ?w)
    (is-wrench ?w)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and

There is an error in the PDDL model:
1. There is some missing precondition in the precondition. This action model incorrectly allows a nut that is not actually in a hub to be tightened.

Please revise the PDDL model (and the list of predicates if needed) to fix the above errors (and other potentially similar errors).

Parameters:
--------------------

assistant:
1. ?n - nut: the nut to be tightened
2. ?h - hub: the hub where the nut is to be tightened
3. ?w - tool: the wrench to be used for tightening the nut

Note that there is no restriction on how many objects the AI agent (i.e., the robot) can carry. Also note that each hub has only one nut.

Action: This action enables the robot to fasten a hub. To achieve this, the robot needs to first put a nut on the hub and then fasten the hub. For example, the robot can fasten hub_1 that has nut_1. Note that although the robot needs to install a nut into the hub, but the robot is not required to tighten the nut in this action. To safely perform this action, the hub needs to be jacked up.

There are some errors in the PDDL model:
1. There is a missing precondition, the hub ?h should be unfastened.
2. There is an incorrect precondition `the nut ?n is loose on the hub ?h`. The robot should be holding the nut, so the nut shouldn't be loose on the hub.
3. There is an incorrect effect `the hub ?h is unfastened`. The hub ?h should be fastened.
4. There is a missing effect: the nut ?n should be loose on the hub.

Please revise the PDDL model (and the list of predicates if needed) to fix the above errors (and other potentially similar errors).

Parameters:

assistant:
1. ?h - hub: the hub to fasten
2. ?n - nut: the nut to put on the hub
