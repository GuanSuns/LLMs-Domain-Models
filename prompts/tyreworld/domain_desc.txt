The AI agent here is a robot that has to replace a flat tyre with a spare one. This involves fetching the tools (wrench, jack, pump) from the boot, undoing the nuts on the flat tyre, jacking up the (appropriate) hub(s), removing the tyre, doing up the spare one, etc. There are three major object types: `small_object`, `container` and `hub`. The object type `small_object` covers tools, wheels and nuts. The `small_object` object type has three subtypes: `tool`, `wheel` and `nut`. The subtype `tool` covers tools like wrenches, jacks, pumps etc. The subtype `wheel` covers various wheels. The subtype `nut` covers various nuts. The object type `container` covers storage spaces like the boot in a car. The object type `hub` covers the hubs in the wheels of the car. Note that there is no restriction on how many objects the AI agent (i.e., the robot) can carry. Also note that each hub has only one nut.
