The AI agent here is a logistics planner that has to plan to transport packages within the locations in a city through a truck and between cities through an airplane. Within a city, the locations are directly linked, allowing trucks to travel between any two of these locations. Similarly, cities are directly connected to each other allowing airplanes to travel between any two cities. Each city is equipped with one truck and has a designated location that functions as an airport. There are five types of object: package, truck, plane, location, and city. There are multiple cities and each city can have multiple locations. Also, there is no limit to how many packages a truck or plane can carry (so in theory a truck or plane can carry an infinite number of packages).
