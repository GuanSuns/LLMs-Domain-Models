Your task is to translate planning domain definition language (PDDL) to natural language in a Pseudo-PDDL format.

Here is an example:

Predicates:
1. (robot-holding ?x - block): true if the robot arm is holding the block ?x
2. (block-clear ?x - block): true if the block ?x is not under any another block
3. (robot-hand-empty): true if the robot arm is not holding any block
4. (block-on-table ?x - block): true if the block ?x is placed on the table

Contextual information: N/A

PDDL:
```
(and
    (not (robot-holding x1))
    (block-clear x1)
    (robot-hand-empty)
    (block-on-table x1)
)
```

Translated PDDL:
(and
    The robot arm is not holding the block x1;
    The block x1 is not under any another block;
    The robot arm is not holding any block;
    The block x1 is placed on the table;
)
